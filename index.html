        <p class="abody">Minecraft is an open sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. This is in the top 3 because it is one of the few games that you can play for years and still not get bored of.</p>

        <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/"><img id="image2" class="aritcle-image" src="portal2.webp"></a>
        <p class="abody">An old game but nevertheless very fun. The game has a great storyline and the portal mechanics are fun to mess with. After berating the game you can play challenge mode to see how fast you can beat the levels. Portal 1 is also great but I personally enjoyed Portal 2 more.</p>

        <p class="abody">Valorant is a fun game to play with friends, however solo queing is one of the worst things you will experience in any video game. Valorant is a 5v5 tactic shooter with one team trying to plant a bomb and defend it, while the other team trys to defuse the bomb.</p>
